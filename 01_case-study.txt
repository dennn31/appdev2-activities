As an experienced professional in the software industry, you are currently employed at a company that has developed its own 
software solution, integrating various third-party software components. Recently, your team encountered a significant challenge
with one of your third-party software providers. The provider notified you that they would cease support for your current 
implementation and required you to upgrade your codebase to align with their new implementation standards.

This unexpected development prompted your team to reflect on your processes and consider preventive measures to mitigate 
similar challenges in the future. While this issue primarily concerns the third-party software provider, it raises questions 
about your approach to software integration and dependency management.

---QUESTION---
3. In what ways can you enhance your software architecture and design to minimize dependencies on external 
components and facilitate easier migration when necessary?


---ANSWER---
*Monitoring Updates: Keep track of updates and announcements from third-party providers regarding changes to their software.
*Proactive Planning: Regularly review your software dependencies and plan for necessary updates or migrations in advance.
*Testing Environment: Maintain a separate testing environment to evaluate how updates from third-party providers might affect your software before implementing them in production.
*Version Control: Use version control systems to manage changes to your codebase, making it easier to roll back changes if necessary.
*Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation of your software's dependencies, integration processes, and any customizations made to third-party components. This helps streamline future updates and troubleshooting efforts.
