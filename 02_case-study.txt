Our IT company embarked on an ambitious project in January 2024 aimed at delivering a cutting-edge software solution to our 
users and clients. The project was meticulously planned with a target launch date of June 1. However, as the deadline approaches, 
it becomes apparent that several tasks are still in progress, and there are unresolved bugs that need attention. The testing process, 
crucial for ensuring product quality, has not yet begun. As a software engineer involved in the project, what aspects could have been 
handled better to prevent the delays and issues experienced, such as incomplete tasks, unresolved bugs, and a delayed testing process?


For this activity, evaluate the situation and offer your suggestions on areas where improvements could have been made.


ANSWER:
1. Early Testing and Bug Tracking
    a. Start Testing Early: Begin testing the software as soon as parts of it are ready, instead of waiting until the end. 
    This helps catch and fix bugs early, making the final testing phase smoother.

    b. Track Bugs: Use a tool to log and prioritize bugs as they are found. Fix the most critical bugs first to prevent them 
    from causing bigger issues later on.


2. Realistic Scheduling and Task Management
    a. Break Down Tasks: Divide the project into smaller tasks with clear deadlines. This makes it easier to track progress 
    and ensures that all team members know what to do.

    b. Set Realistic Deadlines: Base your deadlines on how long similar tasks took in past projects. This helps avoid 
    overestimating how quickly work can be completed and reduces the risk of falling behind.
